Description: A client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
 written in c++ and QT4. The program can be used with most Linux
 desktops (KDE, GNOME, XFCE). 
 .  
 The clean interface makes controlling MPD's features easy and
 intuitive.  The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is
 done entirely by drag & drop; all playback functions are accessible
 from the system tray.  Quimup aims to turn MPD into a perfect desktop
 music player.
