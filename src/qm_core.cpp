	***************************************************************************
	The only purpose of the 'core' is to provide KDE with a main program window
	(albeit invisible) that can be closed on logout. 
	
	If the player window was the main window it would have to ignore() the 
	close-event to allow close-to-tray behavior.
	This would also ignore the close-event evoked by KDE on shutdown, which
	would abort the logout procedure.
	The 'core' will accept the close-event, and it's child (the player) will be
	closed with it.
	The player can close itself by calling qApp->quit().
